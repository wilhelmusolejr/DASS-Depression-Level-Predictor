<p style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto">Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. It is also called as major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave, and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems.</p>

<p>Depression Anxiety Stress Scales Responses is a dataset that was collected online from the various countries during the year of 2017 to 2019 by Openpsychometrics.org on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.psy.unsw.edu.au/dass">Psychology Foundation of Australia | DASS</a> in effort to educate the public about psychology. This dataset contains some background information of the respondents such as their race, education, religion, gender, etc. Furthermore, this dataset includes their responses from the 42 related negative emotional questions which is answerable from the scale of 1 to 4, and the 10-item personality test which is answerable from the scale of 1 to 7. Lastly, this dataset also contains the technical information of the respondent such as, what device they used while taking the test, where they found the test, etc.</p>

## Machine Learning Project Abouts

<p>This machine learning project will create a predictive model using an algorithm that has the highest possible decent accuracy from the various machine learning algorithms. The said model will predict the level of depression of a respondent based on their responses from the 14 depressive emotional questions, 10-item personality test, and their basic information. Lastly, this project will also extract insights and interpret it from the given dataset.</p>


## Features
* Predicts the level of depression based on responses to the questionnaire and basic information.
* Provides insights and interpretation from the dataset.
* Aids in tracking and understanding personal depression levels.
